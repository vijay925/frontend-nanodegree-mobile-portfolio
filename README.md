#### Part 1: Optimize PageSpeed Insights score for index.html

Here is how I optimized the rendering path:

1. Minified HTML, CSS, JS
2. Compressed Images
3. Deferred JS using defer and async attributes
4. Inlined style.css and deferred print.css using `media` attribute

#### Part 2: Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html

I used chrome dev tools to analyze the timeline of the JS execution. I noticed that a few of the functions were doing redundant work and causing constant reevaluation of the styles within a loop. I tried to factor out code that didnâ€™t need to be in the loop and also minimized accessing of DOM objects. It significantly improved the performance and brought the average fps to 60.
